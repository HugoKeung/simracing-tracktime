# simracing-tracktime-angular
Purpose of this web application is to allow user to submit their lap time and details (like setup, telemetry etc.) for various race track.
This will let people compare their lap time with others. They can also look at further details submitted by other users to see which area in particular they can improve on.
Below are some (optional) further details that user can submit alongside their laptime:
1. Sector time
2. Car setup file
3. Telemetry file
4. On board video (only through links uploaded to third party like youtube, streamable etc. for the forseeable future)
5. Additional Notes 


This is the front-end part of the application. Written in angular.
